Attribute noise refers to corruption in the value of one or more attributes
There are three types of attribute noise
Erroneous attribute: The attribute with a wrong value
Missing attribute values: The value of an attribute is unknown. Generally, it is represented as a “?” sign.
Don’t care values: The value of the attribute does not affect the rest of the values in the example
We generate the attribute noise in the training data set using Gaussian noise
Therefore, the values that the noise can take on are Gaussian distributed
