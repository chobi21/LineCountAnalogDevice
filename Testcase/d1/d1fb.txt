We followed the random noise model for class noise injection.
In the literature, there is a lack of work to analyze the impact of noise on different types of classifiers
Therefore, we select five classifiers for our experiments.
The rationale for choosing the classifiers based on their characteristics are three-fold:
A study on either class noise or attribute noise alone cannot provide enough information about classifier behaviors against noise
The experiments carried out in this paper are based on 13 datasets
