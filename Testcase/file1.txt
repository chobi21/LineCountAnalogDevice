Classification is one of the fundamental tasks in machine learning

The quality of data is important in constructing any machine learning model with good prediction performance
Real-world data often suffer from noise
errors, irregularities, and corruptions in a dataset
we have no control over the quality of data used in classification tasks.
The presence of noise in a dataset poses three major negative consequences
a decrease in the classification accuracy
an increase in the complexity of the induced classifier
an increase in the training time
